Git is a version control software.

 

git checkout dev: gets you on branch dev

git fetch origin: gets you up to date with origin

git merge origin/master

 

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github :

git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using :git branch

Which will show :

* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean

Add a new remote for your branch :git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 

Push changes from your commit into your branch :
git push origin [name_of_your_remote]

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :

git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

Delete a branch on your local filesystem:
git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem:
git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github :

git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
